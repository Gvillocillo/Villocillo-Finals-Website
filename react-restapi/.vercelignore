# Vercel Build Configuration
# This file is used by Vercel to build and deploy the application

# Build settings are defined in vite.config.js and package.json
# Vercel automatically detects Vite projects and uses:
# - npm install (or yarn install / pnpm install)
# - npm run build
# - Output directory: dist/

# For SPA routing, index.html is served for all routes
# See vercel.json and vercel.config.js for custom routing rules
